## introduction
This project is used to do the federated learning by applying the digital twin thought to the deeplearning.

Since the data size has been bigger and bigger, using one server to be training center is not suitable to the environment today. Therefore, some company apply the distributed system in the training process of the network.

The idea is that, the company can assign the task of training to the user side instead of the server side. y using the huge amount of the data in the user side, the model will have sufficient samples to get a good result and because the server does not carry the work of training and just update and maintain the model of the network, the training speed can be boosted.
